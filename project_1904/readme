1. BRB count matrix based on mRNA pipeline of snakePipes-2.5.0, located at:

2. running deseq2
    * pairwise comparison, t-test
    * lrt with time as a factor 
        - saved certain clusters
            (/data/akhtar/group2/rabbani/rna_project1904/lrt_factor/genes_in_clusters/)
        - used biomart for these clusters to add their gene names(biomart.ipynb)
