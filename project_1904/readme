1. BRB count matrix based on mRNA pipeline of snakePipes-2.5.0, located at:
   (/data/akhtar/sequencing_data2/210616_A00931_0315_AHFFY7DRXY_lanes1_2/Analysis_1904_Chen_Akhtar/strandedmRNA-Seq_mouse/featureCounts/counts.tsv)

2. running deseq2 v1.26.0:
    * pairwise comparison, t-test is applied on a design based on both condition and treatment
    * lrt on redusced model after removing the interaction between time and condition, time is considered as a factor variable. 
        - saved certain clusters
            (/data/akhtar/group2/rabbani/rna_project1904/lrt_factor/genes_in_clusters/)
        - used biomart for these clusters to add their gene names(biomart.ipynb)
            (/data/akhtar/group2/rabbani/rna_project1904/lrt_factor/genes_in_clusters/clustered_genes_with_gene_name)
    * lrt on redusced model after removing the interaction between time and condition, time is considered as a int variable.
