2. running deseq2 v1.26.0:
    * pairwise comparison, t-test is applied on a design based on both condition and treatment
    * lrt on reduced model after removing the interaction between time and condition, time is considered as a int variable. 

3. DEGreport v1.22.0 is used for clusteing the differential analysis result
